# about os 
A python mock os, I don't know how this is functioning correctly to be honest lol :D 

# username.pass file is created on first setup
Default password is: test 

## Make sure you run the setup file first!
* also make sure you create a **Games** folder inside the project directory and a **data** folder for username and password storage
