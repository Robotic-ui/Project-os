A python mock os, I don't know how this is functioning correctly to be honest lol :D 

* username.pass file is created on first setup
* Default password is: test

## Step 1
* Create a **Games** folder inside the project directory place Pong.py, Snake.py and Tetris.py into this folder
* Create a data folder for username and password storage, File names should be: username.pass & password.pass

## Step 2  
* run Setup.py

* Go through the setup page and enjoy :)
